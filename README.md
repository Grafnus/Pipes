# What's a pipe in Minecraft?
Pipes is a item transport, distributing and sorting plugin made to minimize lag through conventional item transportation and/or sorting mechanisms. 
Usually item transportation is done using hoppers, dispensers or ice/water ways and sorted by an itemsorting construct also using hoppers etc. 
That is can very quickly cause significant drops in the servers TPS. Pipes introduces a lightweight way for players to archive the same and even better systems while keeping the cost reasonable high.
