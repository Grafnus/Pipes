# Pipes
Pipes is a simple item transport and sorting plugin made to minimize lag through conventional item transportation and/or sorting mechanisms. 
Usually item transportation is done using hoppers, dispensers or ice/water ways and sorted by an itemsorting construct also using hoppers etc. 
That is usually not a problem on a small to mid scale, but as a server grows older and bigger they start to grow aswell. This leads to an increasing load on the server.
